Our project treats **IMPERFECT COMPETITION** in three different ways and investigates the effects of tweaking imperfect competition in different directions.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). The results uses functions defined in our .py-file [modelproject.py](modelproject.py)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
