# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Robotics across industries** and is about the development of robots in different industries and the resulting effect on productivity.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. NP25.csv (*[source](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/np25)*) 
2. ifr_dk.csv (*source*)
3. NABB69 from Danmarks Statestik https://www.statistikbanken.dk/np25

We import the following dictionaries from **dict.py**:
1. dict_crosswalk: Contains a crosswalk file for converting the industry classifications from Danmarks Statistik in to the classification system from the Industrial Federation of Robotics.
2. dict_legend:    Translation for the industry classifications for IFR in to more appropriate legend titles.
