# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Robotics across industries** and is about the development of robots in different industries and the resulting effect on productivity.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. NP25.csv (*[source](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/np25)*) 
2. ifr_dk.csv (*source*)
3. NABB69 from Danmarks Statestik https://www.statistikbanken.dk/np25

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
